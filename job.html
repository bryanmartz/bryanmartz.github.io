		<p>I molded my tireless work ethic through participating in football from a young age. However, I'm not your typical football player. It is important to be well-rounded and versitile. I am also a member of the Willamette choir and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/saeogamma?fref=ts">Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity member.</a></p>

		<i>Young professional seeking experience in communications field with an emphasis in marketing or sales management.</i>
		
			<h3>2015 Graduate of Willamette University</h3>
				<p>My education at Willamette has taught me the importance of learning how to interact and work with diverse groups of people. Through leadership experience in multiple different groups, I have learned the importance of listening and learning before you can attack the problems and issues that you have to address.</p> 
				<p>The best leaders are the individuals that can lead with actions before they lead with their words. I have become an individual that has depended on my strong work ethic and learning about others before I can find the success that I strive to achieve.</p>
