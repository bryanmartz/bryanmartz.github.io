		<p>I enjoy each of these sites for similar reasons. They are each visually simple and utilize images or graphics to give the page a very transparent identity. With the first one, it gives simple headline that describes the person in a very easy way. It also concisely describes the purpose for her website and identifies the reasons people will visit her site with the banner listings. As for the second website, I enjoy it because there is a clear identity through the image on the right side of the page. It also gives a simple listing of his background and gives links to more detailed social networks that give viewers a better idea of who he is. With the Alex Nuth personal website, it is the most visually simple website on my list. It gives the viewer a clear identity of the individual and a consise description of who they are. For the Ian Enders personal website, it is very similar to the third site on the list. It shows the viewer an image of the person and lists out the information about who they are. It gives a concise description about where he has been and where he currently is in his career. The last website has the most persuasive power out of any of the websites. It also has a different end and that is reflected with the layout of it. It is not just descriptive like the other ones. It does describe enough about the person in order for the viewer to get a complete just of what he is doing.<p>
			
			<h2>Content</h2>

			<p>This website will serve as my personal website and contribute to my personal brand. I will include it on my LinkedIn page and try to keep its content consistent with the nature of my other social media content. It will include the following aspects of my personal brand. I will include the following information:</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li>Resum√© and other job materials</li>
			<li>Social media feeds for cross promotion</li>
			<li>Personal Blog</li>
			<li>Bearcat Football Updates</li>
		</ul>

<p>I would like my website to have both information needed for professional branding, but I also want it to be personalized and unique. It is important to stand out and also to emphasize what you are passionate about. I loved my college football experience and it is something that will help me stand out from a crowd. If I am trying to attract a creative mind to your website, I need to be unique but also be true to who I am.<p>
